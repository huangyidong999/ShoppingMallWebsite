Navigate:
(1) <nav></nav> is just like <div></div>, the difference is that nav will tell our browser: this content is for navigating
(2)pull-right is from bootstarp, !important means the high priority
(3)span can use the class to show different pictures
=========================================================================================
Search:
(1) div can name with "Class" attribute, and we can use this name on css file like div.Name
(2) when we use the "input" we can use the "placeholder" attribute the give the raw display.
(3)when the button type is "submit" which means the content will send to server.
At the Css: (1)  if we use border: 1px solid transparent; means 框设置成透明的，否则会有边框阴影
(2) a:hover means the display when our mouse cover that area
